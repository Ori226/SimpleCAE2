# SimpleCAE 


An attempt to create CAE using keras. Instead of using denoising I used  Keras dropout.

There is a class that I didn't used called "DenseWithCorruption.py". I implemented it before realizing I can use the drop out layer.

This is not a classical CAE since it not do the complete reverse operation. The main thing here is that it show the usage of the reverse maxpool layer
